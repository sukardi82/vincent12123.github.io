## Chapter 1: Initial Set Up

This chapter covers how to properly configure your computer to work on Django projects. We
start with an overview of the command line and how to install the latest version of Django and
Python. Then we discuss virtual environments, git, and working with a text editor. By the end of
this chapter you’ll be ready to create and modify new Django projects in just a few keystrokes.
The Command Line
The command line is a powerful, text-only view of your computer. As developers we will use it
extensively throughout this book to install and configure each Django project.
On a Mac, the command line is found in a program called Terminal. To find it, open a new Finder
window, open the Applications directory, scroll down to open the Utilities directory, and doubleclick
the application called Terminal.
On Windows machines there are actually two built-in command shells: the Command shell and
PowerShell. You should use PowerShell, which is the more powerful of the two.
Going forward when the book refers to the “command line” it means to open a new console on
your computer, using either Terminal or PowerShell.
While there are many possible commands we can use, in practice there are six used most
frequently in Django development:
- cd (change down a directory)
- cd .. (change up a directory)
- ls (list files in your current directory on Mac)
- dir (list files in your current directory on Windows)
- pwd (print working directory)
- mkdir (make directory)
- touch (create a new file on Mac)
Open your command line and try them out. The dollar sign ($) is our command line prompt: all
commands in this book are intended to be typed after the $ prompt.
For example, assuming you’re on a Mac, let’s change into our Desktop directory.
Command Line
``` 
cd ~/Desktop
```
Note that our current location, /Desktop, is automatically added before our command line
prompt. To confirm we’re in the proper location we can use pwd which will print out the path of
our current directory.
Command Line
```
~/Desktop $ pwd
/Users/wsv/desktop
```

On my Mac computer this shows that I’m using the user wsv and on the desktop for that account.
Now let’s create a new directory with mkdir, cd into it, and add a new file index.html with
the touch command. Note that Windows machines unfortunately do not support a native touch
command. In future chapters when instructed to create a new file, do so within your text editor
of choice.
Command Line
```
~/Desktop $ mkdir new_dir && cd new_dir
~/Desktop/new_dir $ touch index.html
```
Now use ls to list all current files in our directory. You’ll see there’s just the newly created
index.html.
Command Line
```
~/Desktop/new_dir $ ls
index.html
```
As a final step, return to the Desktop directory with cd .. and use pwd to confirm the location.
Command Line
```
~/Desktop/new_dir $ cd ..
~/Desktop $ pwd
/Users/wsv/desktop
```
Advanced developers can use their keyboard and command line to navigate through their
computer with ease. With practice this approach is much faster than using a mouse.
In this book I’ll give you the exact instructions to run–you don’t need to be an expert on the
command line–but over time it’s a good skill for any professional software developer to develop.
A good free resource for further study is the Command Line Crash Course16.
## Install Python 3
It takes some configuration to properly install Python 3 on a Mac, Windows, Linux, or Chromebook
computer and there are multiple approaches. Many developers–especially beginners–
follow the advice on the official Python website17 to download distinct versions of Python directly
onto their computer and then adjust the PATH variable18 accordingly.
The problem with this approach is that updating the PATH variable correctly is tricky, by
downloading Python directly updates are harder to maintain, and there are now much easier
ways to install and start using Python quickly.
I host a dedicated website, InstallPython3.com19, with up-to-date guides for installing Python
3 on Mac, Windows, or Linux computers. Please refer there to install Python correctly on your
local machine.
