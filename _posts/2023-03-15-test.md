## Why Django

A web framework is a collection of modular tools that abstracts away much of the difficulty–
and repetition–inherent in web development. For example, most websites need the same basic
functionality: the ability to connect to a database, set URL routes, display content on a page,
handle security properly, and so on. Rather than recreate all of this from scratch, programmers
over the years have created web frameworks in all the major programming languages: Django
and Flask5 in Python, Rails6 in Ruby, and Express7 in JavaScript among many, many others.
Django inherited Python’s “batteries-included” approach and includes out-of-the box support
for common tasks in web development, including:

* user authentication
* testing
* database models, forms, URL routes, and templates
* admin interface
* security and performance upgrades
* support for multiple database backends

This approach allows web developers to focus on what makes a web application unique rather
than reinventing the wheel every time for standard, secure web application functionality.
In contrast, several popular frameworks–most notably Flask in Python and Express in JavaScript–
adopt a “microframework” approach. They provide only the bare minimum required for a simple
web page and leave it up to the developer to install and configure third-party packages to
replicate basic website functionality. This approach provides more flexibility to the developer
but also yields more opportunities for mistakes.
As of 2019 Django has been under active development for over 14 years which makes it a grizzled
veteran in software years. Millions of programmers have already used Django to build their
websites, which is undeniably a good thing. Web development is hard. It doesn’t make sense to

repeat the same code–and mistakes–when a large community of brilliant developers has already
solved these problems for us.
At the same time, Django remains under active development8 and has a yearly release schedule.
The Django community is constantly adding new features and security improvements. And best
of all it’s written in the wonderfully readable yet still powerful Python programming language. In
short, if you’re building a website from scratch Django is a fantastic choice.

## Why This Book
I wrote this book because while Django is extremely well documented9 there is a severe lack of
beginner-friendly tutorials available. When I first learned Django years ago, I struggled to even
complete the official polls tutorial10. Why was this so hard I remember thinking?
With more experience, I now recognize that the writers of the Django docs faced a difficult
choice: they could emphasize Django’s ease-of-use or its depth, but not both. They choose
the latter and as a professional developer I appreciate the choice, but as a beginner I found it
so…frustrating! My goal with this book is to fill in the gaps and showcase how beginner-friendly
Django really can be.
You don’t need previous Python or web development experience to complete this book. It is
intentionally written so that even a total beginner can follow along and feel the magic of writing
their own web applications from scratch. However if you are serious about a career in web
development, you will eventually need to invest the time to properly learn Python, HTML, and
CSS. A list of recommended resources for further study is included in the Conclusion.
