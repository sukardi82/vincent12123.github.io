## Chapter 1: Initial Set Up

This chapter covers how to properly configure your computer to work on Django projects. We
start with an overview of the command line and how to install the latest version of Django and
Python. Then we discuss virtual environments, git, and working with a text editor. By the end of
this chapter you’ll be ready to create and modify new Django projects in just a few keystrokes.
The Command Line
The command line is a powerful, text-only view of your computer. As developers we will use it
extensively throughout this book to install and configure each Django project.
On a Mac, the command line is found in a program called Terminal. To find it, open a new Finder
window, open the Applications directory, scroll down to open the Utilities directory, and doubleclick
the application called Terminal.
On Windows machines there are actually two built-in command shells: the Command shell and
PowerShell. You should use PowerShell, which is the more powerful of the two.
Going forward when the book refers to the “command line” it means to open a new console on
your computer, using either Terminal or PowerShell.
While there are many possible commands we can use, in practice there are six used most
frequently in Django development:
- cd (change down a directory)
- cd .. (change up a directory)
- ls (list files in your current directory on Mac)
- dir (list files in your current directory on Windows)
- pwd (print working directory)
- mkdir (make directory)
- touch (create a new file on Mac)
Open your command line and try them out. The dollar sign ($) is our command line prompt: all
commands in this book are intended to be typed after the $ prompt.
For example, assuming you’re on a Mac, let’s change into our Desktop directory.
Command Line
``` 
cd ~/Desktop
```
Note that our current location, /Desktop, is automatically added before our command line
prompt. To confirm we’re in the proper location we can use pwd which will print out the path of
our current directory.
